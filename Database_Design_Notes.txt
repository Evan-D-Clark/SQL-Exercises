Understand the requirements
Build a conceptual model
	The things and concepts the database will work with
	Typical technologies: Entity Relationship and UML
		draw.io is a good platform for this
Build a logical model
	Specify type of each attribute
	Specify relationship between entities
Build a physical model
	Implement logical model with specific technology
	Add primary/foreign keys to each table
	Forign key references the primary key of another table
		(update foreign key on update [almost always cascade] 
			and on delete [case by case])
	Composite primary key uses two keys to be uniquely identified
	Check for redundancy (normalization)
1NF
	Each cell should have a single value and we cannot have repeated columns
2NF
	Every table should describe one entity, and every column in that table
		should describe that entity.
3NF
	A column in a table shouldn't be derived from others in that table.
Focus on removing repitition and keep requirements in mind. Don't solve problems that don't
	exist (don't fear ghosts)
